# Yet another rust based spotify tool

Barebones tool for how I like to use Spotify.
I have been using spotifyd + spotify-tui, but spotify-tui is unmaintained.
So I fugred I'd roll my own. 

### Setup
1. Setup a new app through spotify's developer portal
2. create a .env file with RSPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID/RSPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET/RSPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI
